# refcard

A reference card class for LaTeX2e.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_sheet), 
a cheat sheet is a concise set of notes used for quick reference.
Some might even call it a [reference card or sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_card), 
hence the name.

This class is still in development.
